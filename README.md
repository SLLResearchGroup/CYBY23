Information on the Cyberbullying Bystander (CYBY23) Dataset 
---------------------------------------------------
The data is stored as a .xlsx. The data file contains 5 columns:

tweet_id = id number of each tweet

reply_id = conversation id number, identical for all tweets belong to the same thread

text = text of tweet

class label = prsent the level of aggression of the whole thread by
three-point scale (0-1-2).
0 - aggression
1 - bullying with low aggression
2 - bullying with high aggression


bystander role label = present the role of bystander who reply to the main tweet,as (0-1-2-3).
0 - instigator- This person agree with the main post
1 - defender- This person disagree with the main post
2 - impartial - This person is not taking any sides
3 -  other - This person posted unrelated replies
